The project involves creating a chatbot using Amazon Lex, which handles natural language processing and understanding. The Lex bot is integrated with AWS Lambda functions to add custom logic and functionality. The Lex bot and Lambda functions are also connected to the CloudWatch service for logging and monitoring.
The chatbot is then integrated with the kommunicate.io platform, which provides a user interface and additional features for the chatbot. The chatbot integration code is added to an index.html file, which is then hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket for serving the website with the embedded chatbot.
The overall goal is to create a functional chatbot that can interact with users through a website, leveraging AWS services like Lex, Lambda, CloudWatch, and S3 for different aspects of the chatbot's implementation and deployment.
